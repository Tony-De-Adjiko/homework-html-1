        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>Shrek is a fictional ogre character created by American author William Steig. Shrek is the protagonist of the
            book of the same name, a series of films by DreamWorks Animation, as well as a musical. The name "Shrek" is
            a romanization of the Yiddish word שרעק (shrek), or שרעקלעך (shreklekh), related to the German Schreck and
            meaning "fear" or "fright".[2] In the films, Shrek was voiced by Mike Myers, and in the musical, he was
            played principally by Brian d'Arcy James.
            On May 21, 2010, Shrek received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles. In June 2010,
            Entertainment Weekly named him one of the "100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years", placing 15th</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px">Shrek is a large, green-skinned, physically intimidating ogre with a Scottish accent. In Shrek Forever After,
            however, it is revealed that he is much smaller than the average ogre. Even though his background is
            something of a mystery, according to Shrek the Musical, it is revealed that on his seventh birthday, Shrek
            was sent away by his parents, because it was an ogre tradition. (The original book also has his parents
            evicting him from their swamp.) He is seen traveling alone, being either screamed at or teased by
            passers-by. The only time he receives a pleasant greeting is a wave from a young Fiona, who is promptly led
            away by her parents. In the book, his parents threw him into a dark hole that leads to the real world.</p>
