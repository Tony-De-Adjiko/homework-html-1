<p><b>Peter Pan</b> is a fictional character created by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Scottish_novelists">Scottish novelist</a>and playwright <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._Barrie"> J. M. Barrie</a>. A free-spirited and mischievous young boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures on the mythical island of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverland">Neverland</a> as the leader of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Boys_(Peter_Pan)">Lost Boys</a>, interacting with<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy">fairies</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy">pirates</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mermaid">mermaids</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas">Native Americans</a>, and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside Neverland.</p>
<p>Peter Pan has become a cultural icon symbolizing youthful innocence and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapism">escapism</a>. In addition to two distinct works by Barrie,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_White_Bird">The Little White Bird</a> (1902, with chapters 13–18 published in<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens">Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</a> in 1906), and the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre">West End stage</a> play<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy">Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up</a> (1904, which expanded into the 1911 novel

<p>Barrie commissioned a statue of Peter Pan by the sculptor George Frampton, which was erected overnight in Kensington Gardens on 30 April 1912 as a surprise to the children of London.[1] Six other statues have been cast from the original mould and displayed around the world. In 2002, Peter Pan featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail on the centenary of Barrie's creation of the character.[2]</p>
<h2>Origin  <span>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Pan&action=edit&section=1">edit</a>]</span></h2>
<hr>
<p>Peter Pan first appeared as a character in Barrie's The Little White Bird (1902), a novel for adults. In chapters 13–18, titled "Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens", Peter is a seven-day-old baby and has flown from his nursery to Kensington Gardens in London, where the fairies and birds taught him to fly. He is described as "betwixt-and-between" a boy and a bird. Barrie returned to the character of Peter Pan, putting him at the centre of his stage play titled Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, which premiered on 27 December 1904 at the Duke of York's Theatre in London.[3] Following the success of the 1904 play, Barrie's publishers, Hodder and Stoughton, extracted the Peter Pan chapters of The Little White Bird and published them in 1906 under the title Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, with the addition of illustrations by Arthur Rackham.[4] Barrie later adapted and expanded the 1904 play's storyline as a novel, which was published in 1911 as Peter and Wendy.</p>
<p>J. M. Barrie may have based the character of Peter Pan on his older brother, David, who died in an ice-skating accident the day before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother thought of him as forever a boy.[5]</p>

<h3>Family  <span>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Pan&action=edit&section=1">edit</a>]</span></h3>
<p>Peter Pan ran away from his parents when he was a baby as told in Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens and Peter and Wendy. Finding the window closed and seeing a new baby boy in the house when he returned some time later, he believed his parents no longer wanted him and never came back. This younger sibling is referred to in the chapter "Lock-Out Time" in Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens but is not mentioned again.</p>

<h4>Maimie Mannering  <span>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Pan&action=edit&section=1">edit</a>]</span></h4>
<p>While in Kensington Gardens, Peter meets a lost girl named Maimie Mannering and the two quickly become friends. Peter proposes marriage to Maimie. While Maimie wants to stay in the Gardens with Peter, she comes to realise that her mother is so worried that she must return to her. Maimie promises to always remember Peter and goes back to her mother. When Maimie grows up, she continues to think of Peter, dedicating presents and letters to him. To remember Maimie, Peter rides the imaginary goat that Maimie created for him. She is considered to be the literary predecessor of Wendy Darling.[17]</p>
