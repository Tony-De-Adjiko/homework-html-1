            <h3>What integrations do you support?</h3>
            <p>We can support platforms integrated with Checkout, Billing, and Invoicing. We can’t support PaymentIntent
                users but if you’re a platform interested in building your own UI forмone‑off payments, we’d love to
                hear from you!</p>

            <h3>Do you support PO box addresses?</h3>
            <p>In general, PO Boxes aren’t part of our US address database. If the address for a PO Box or other address
                can’t be found in the address database, the location is approximated using the rest of the address
                details, such as the postal code.</p>
